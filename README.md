This assignment applies different codes for data wrangling and visualization 

Problem 1 
This problem specifies some conditions to filter the dataframe and selects a few columns to be displayed. 

a.) Instru 

Output
```
	Name	GEAS	Electronics
0	  S1	  75	         89
7	  S8	  64	         81
29	 S30	  57	         81

```

b.) Mindy 

Output 
```
	Name	         Track	   Electronics
1	  S2	 Communication	            75
2	  S3   Instrumentation	            74
14	 S15  Microelectronics	            41
16	 S17  Microelectronics	            79
19	 S20	 Communication	            60

```
