# Telano-Jared-Christian-P._PA4_2ECE-A

This assignment applies different codes for data wrangling and visualization 

**Problem 1** 

This problem specifies some conditions to filter the dataframe and selects a few columns to be displayed. This problem mainly uses codes from the pandas library, such as df.loc[], to access rows, columns, and labels. 

a.) Instru 

Output
```
	Name	GEAS	Electronics
0	  S1	  75	         89
7	  S8	  64	         81
29	 S30	  57	         81

```

b.) Mindy 

Output 
```
	Name	         Track	   Electronics
1	  S2	 Communication	            75
2	  S3   Instrumentation	            74
14	 S15  Microelectronics	            41
16	 S17  Microelectronics	            79
19	 S20	 Communication	            60

```


**Problem 2** 

This problem uses the same dataframe as Problem 1. The codes applied here are from matplotlib.plyplot library to visualize the data needed. This program visualizes how certain features such as track, gender, and hometown contributes to average grade. With this visualization, the little discrepancies between the average scores per subgroup imply that these selected attributes do not necessarily contribute to a higher average score.
